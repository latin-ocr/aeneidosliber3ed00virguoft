she is equal to what the proper respect for Ascanius and Aeneas
re ulres.

the difficulty then arises from the fact that the phrase is imagi-
native: honos is half personified (as all poets‚ and esp. Vergil, do),
and Andromache does not give way to him but is equal to his de-
mands.

This I believe is what Servius means: ‘tanta dat munera quanta
merebatur Ascanius’.

Ριῖ89. super, adverbial use, here almost adjectival ‘the only image
left me of my boy Astyanax’.

Astyanax son of Hector and Andromache. The parting of these
two, and the terror of the child at his father’s helmet, is one of the best
known passages of the Iliad. ,

composition in this sense, as obduco, obtego, obeo, occulo.

Tghe promise contained in these lines points to some recent events
connecting Epirus closer with Italy. Servius mentions specially the
founding of lVicopolis by Augustus (on the neck of the Ambracian gulf,
in memory of the battle of Actium). It had the privileges of a libera
