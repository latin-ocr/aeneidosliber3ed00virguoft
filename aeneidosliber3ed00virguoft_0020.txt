Or this from Milton' s Christmas Ode. ··—

“And kings sate still with awful eye,
As if they surely knew their sovran lord was by.’'

In these none but the commonest words are used, and yet
the poetical ffctiveness of the style is consummate. Now take

as an example of the elaborate style Hamlet's exclamation to
the Ghost:

‘but tell
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,

These instances will illustrate one form of the contrast
between the two styles; and there are many other forms.
Shakespeare will supply many illustrations of both being a
dramatist and a geniuS‚ he speaks in many voices. So do
many if not most poets of the first rank. Wordsworth however
is a notable instance of the simplest style: Pindar perhaps the
best of the elaborate style. The poets of this century in
England, feeling as they did the strength of a reaction against
the artificial style of Pope and his fossowers, produced many
examples besides Wordsworth of the simple style, such as
Moore, Southey, Campbell, much of Bvron and Coleridge and
the whole of Walter Scott. Two of the greatest however,
Keats and Shelley‚ from the gorgeous imagination of the one
and the profound inspiration of the other, supply more examples
of the elaborate and forcible style. μ V

is true that he can be simple, and often is : he is much too great
