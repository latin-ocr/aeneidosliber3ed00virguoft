Without discussing the question fully, which would not be
suitable in a brief edition like the present, a word on the ques-
tion of Vergil's imitations may be found useful.

The main point is that the modern idea of imitation is
entirely different from that which was held by the Roman
literary men, and which indeed could not fail to be held by
them. With us, literary productions belong indeed mostly to
one or other main class, and so far are composed under condi·
tions which prescribe the form ε though even here constantly new
varieties are invented: but both in style and subject-matter, the
aim of all great writers is to be original. The Roman literature
on the other hand was mainly formed on Greek models; and to
adhere to those models closely, to be constantly reminding the
readers of them, to imitate them much in the treatment, in
the phraseology, and even in the incident, was inevitable to the
Latin poets; or, rather, it was one of the very things they pro-
posed to do in writing¹. Vergil’s style, indeed, is completely his
own, and entirely unlike Homer’s, as is plain from what has been
said; his main purpose and subject are entirely his own, and
truly Roman 3 he borrows where he does borrow (and that from
Ennius, Cyclic poets, Greek tragedians, and many others besides
Homer) always to suit his own purpose, and not in a servile
manner; and he invariably remains master of his materia18‚ and
stamps his own mark indelibly upon them.

But to understand Vergil, it is clearly necessary to grasp
the conditions under which he worked; and nothing can be a
greater mistake than to feel surprise at the extent to which he
was indebted to his predecessors in the poetic art
