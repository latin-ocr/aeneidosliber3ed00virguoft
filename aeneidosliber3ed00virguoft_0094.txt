Press Notices

“This work is a kind of encyclopaedia z‘n minimo.. ..The amount of
information gathered into seven hundred pages is a marvel... ..And
strange to say, the book is quite pleasant to read in spite of its in-
numerable facts. The printing is admirable and the volume is well
illustrated... ‚Mr Whibley is to be congratulated on his book. The
country can produce a body of scholars as careful as the Germans...and

their judgment is notably sane.'’—Guard2·an

“The scheme of the book is good. It is not a mere collection of
interesting miscellanea, but a clear and connected account of Greek life
and thought, written by scholars who are intimately acquainted with all
the latest developments of the subject....The mass of erudition that is
packed between its covers is astonishing... .It is thorough in the sense
that, in the majority of the articles, at least, the substance of our know-
ledge 1s given, the essential points are touched upon, and the theories of
first· rate importance are concisely stated.' ³—Saturday Revzew

“‘1t 1s a handbook that no one will be ashamed to own and consult,
a handbook that will be sure to fill a place not only m libraries designed
for the young, but also on the desk of the teacher, and on the shelves

. of the scholar... ‚It is a good book worthy of English scholarship.

Journal of Education

“The completeness of the scope is obvious. The excellence of the
work is guaranteed by the names of the contributors. The volume
should be on the Greek library shelves of every school where Greek is
seriously taught. Not for reference merely; it will be read with avidity,
apart from task-work‚ by any boy that has the root of the matter in him.
The book is beautifully printed and produced.''—-Educational Times

“ This is an admirable book, in design and execution alike....The
choice of writers is above reproach.,..Secondly‚ the choice of matters is
good. ...Thirdly‚ the book is readable: it is not merely a work of refer-
ence. ...The pages are full of illustrations from art, Realien, inscriptionS,
manuscripts; the printing is worthy of the Press; and the whole book
is good to look upon.''—Cambrz'dge Revz'ew
