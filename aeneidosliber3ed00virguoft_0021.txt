an artist to ignore any poetic resource. But sor the rnost part
he does not aim at expressing his thoughts in the simplest, but
rather in the most striking manner. He often employs ‘an

elaboration of language which disdains or is unable to say a
plain thing in a plain way¹.' He· arrests attention by the

vigour, the strangeness, the intensity, the emphasis, if I may so
phrase it, of his language. He is often stretching constructions

, or the sense of wordS, using abstract for concrete, part for the

whole, adjective for adverb; transferring epithets‚ varying, in-
verting, seeking the unusual instead of the ordinary phrase.
In short he is con stantly surprising the reader.

The good side of these peculiarities is freshness and force:
the bad side is affectation. The protections against affectation
are of course the poet’s own taste‚ command of expression,
ear sor melody, 'dignity‚ imagination‚ and skill; and all these
qualities Vergil possesses in a consummate degree.

Instances of these peculiarities the reader will find by referring
to the Index of Style at the end: and there is much more of
the same kind that he can discover for himself. Vergil's work-
manship is so careful and so perfect, that he is an inexhaustible

field for the literary analyst.

To discover all the passages where Vergil echoes lines or
phrases of earlier ancient, and especially Greek, poets‚ would
be an endless task: but those places in this book which were
clearly suggested, more or less consciously, by Homer, will be
found collected in the Appendix at the end of the notes in the
form of a list drawn up by aid of the commentators.

os the Aeneid' by Prof. Nettleship; a pamphlet which all students of
Vergil will find most instructive, interesting and suggestive, as indeed is
to be expected of so distinguished a scholar.
