NOTES. 69

stantives in Vergil, deum, virum, divom, Aeneadum, caelicolum, &c.‚
rare in adj. cf. vl. 307. See note on 5.

The hJorses of Agrigentum were famous in old days (quondam)

before the Punic wars which desolated Sicily. Of course to say
m in this sense is an anachronism z but then the whole mention

of these Sicilian Greek colonies is an anachronism.

f706. ‘And thread the shoals of Lilybaeum perilous, with sunken

ree s '. ' >

dura is ‘ dangerous ' ‘ difficult 'z metaphorical hardness.

707. Drepanum at N.W. end of Sicily. The coast here is flat,
ugly‚'and barren ε truly inlaetabilis.

7¹¹· erepte: voc. attracted from ereptus„ see above.-

718. ‘He ceased‚ and made an end, and held his peace ’. It
is idle to find distinctions. Vergil as osten varies the word but not the
real sense. The labour had been long and exciting. and the poet not
unnaturally emphasizes the end of it.

The quievit os the chief actor is an almost ironic contrast to the
terrible passion and tragedy of Dido which is coming.
