678. caelo, ‘to heaven '‚ Vergilian dat. for ad caelum 177.

680. Greek rhythm with Greek word cypanksi.

682. ᾳιιοαινὲᾳιαεε, used by a commyolh irregularity for ‘anywlzerc’
“lu‘ffibe‘ or quovis), see 654: the word goes with the whole idea
o sailing away which is elaborated into two clauses ‘rudentes ex-
cutere...intendere vela’.

684—686. A difficult passage. It clears the groundto recognise
that ni is here=ne.· for any attempt to translate ni as nisi makes no
possible or satisfactory sense, and Servius shews that it was anciently
taken as ne here. [We have nive for neve Lucr. 11. 734: cave ni
neges, for ne, Cat. LXI. 15²² and in inscriptions of the 2nd cent.
B.c. nei and ni are sar commonet than nc. They are all originally
simple negatives (cf. ni-mirum ‘no wonder ’) and the appropriation of
the form ne for ‘that not’ is merely an ordinary example os dif-
ferentiafiom]

The only way we can then take it with existing text is as Conington,
⁸ But the bidding of Helenus warns them not to steer betwixt Scylla and
Charybdis, a handbreadth from death on either hand z so they resolve to
sail back ‘. The general sense seems to be ‘we dare not row on,
coasting Southwards, sor fear of Cyclopes, but must put out to sea with
the wind z but we must not (we remember) go North, for Helenus has
warned us= therefore we resolve to sail back [i. e. north-east, not to the
stt-aits, but to the coast of Bruttium]. But lo, a north wind comes and
wafts us on our proper course '.

This makes perfectly good, though rather compleX, sense, and may
be adopted; though certainly it is obscurely expressed.

Madvig’s ingenious suggestion to destroy the stop at cursus, and
read contra ac (followed by K.) simplifies it: ‘Contrary to Helenus'
warning, not to steer betwixt Scylla and Charybdis, a handbreadth from
death on either hand, we resolve to sail back [N orthwards]'. For
though they had not come actually from the straits, they had been
coming some time in that direction.

But the other is really more natural: contra is better as a con-
ηεοῐίῗζς adv-3 and monent better as a principal verb, else the sentence
is aw ward.

685. utramque...parv0: a very Vergilian inversion. Literally
‘either course with a slight remove from death ’‚ where there was only
one course, and he means to say ‘ a course on either hand but slightly
removed .

viam is in apposition to cursus: and discrimine loose but con-
venient abl. of attendant circumstances,

688. vivo, ‘living’ rock, i. e. not an artificially built harbour but a
natural rocky basin, such as is the mouth of the little river Pantagias,
south of the bay of Catana.

689. South of Pantagias comes the promontory of Taurus: then
