248. Laomedontiadas ‘ sons of Laomedon ’, i. e. perjured race. Lao-
medon king of Troy had the gods Poseidon (Neptune) and Apollo to serve
him for a time, and agreed that Poseidon should build the city walls for
a price. The walls were built, and the king refused to pay. ‘ Ex quo
destituit deos mercede pacta Laomedon ' Hor. Od. 111. 3. 21. This
perjury was a stock reproach ε Laomedonteae sentis periuria gentis, lv.
542 2 periurae moenia Troiae V. 811.

249· patrio regno, ‘the kingdom our heritage ’‚ as daughters of the
sea god they make this grandiloquent claim.

252. Furiarum, the Harpies here classed among the Furies‚ as
being horrid monsters of similar kind.

2 56. nostraeque iniuria caedis, ‘ your murderous wrong to us '.

257. ambesas absumere, ‘to gnaw and devour ’‚ accumulated expres-
sion, like fixum sedet, conversa tulere, sublapsa referri, deceptam morte
fifilllzit. But ambesas, ‘ gnawed round ’‚ suggests the dffculty of eating
tab es.

In vn. ι22 the prophecy is fulfilled, to the ear but not to the sense,
by the Trojans accidentally piling their food on wheaten cakes and then
eating the cakes. The boy Ascanius eries out ‘ See we eat our tables
too Γ By a curious slip Vergil there attributes the Harpy’s prophecy to
Aeneas’ dead father Anchises.

subtssgnt subj. expresses the indefiniteness of the time of fulfilment
like Greek subj. after πρὶν ἄν.

262. Notice subj. after sive, due as usual to the orat. obliq. These
clauses are part of the prayer.

264. meritos honores, 118.

266. placidi, ‘unvexed', ‘unwrathful'. So Plaut. Curc. has reddere
placidum for to appease.

27ο. Zacynthos [licence of short vowel before z is imitated from
Homer] island off Elis. Neritos mountain in N. of Ithaca. Dulichi-
um and Same are quoted from Homer, Od. 1. 246, and it is impos·
sible to identify them with certainty : the geography is inaccurate and
confused. Cephallenia is probably meant by one or both ι but the
writer is not clear.

Vergil prefers to adopt the Homeric erroneous geography: indeed

must be the point ⁴ dreaded by sailors ', and not the temple of Apollo
at Actium (further N. again at the entrance to Ambracian gulf), where
Vergil certainly means that they landed. The probability is that, as
