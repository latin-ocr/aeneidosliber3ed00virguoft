slight as it is, illustrates Vergil's use of the simile. Ordinarily
with our poet the thing compared, the point of the resemblance,
is obvious: giants tall as trees; warriors raging like bulls,
lions, wolves, or boars; missiles like rain; an army like a
stream or a fire. But the workmanship is careful, and the
details of the picture are elaborated independently of the
resemblance. The simile is not meant to illustrate,· it is
simply used as a variety, a relief to the story, an adornment.

So here, the lines are beautiful : aeriae quercus aut coniferae
cyparzlrsz' with its sound and suggestion takes us quite away for
the moment from the scared Trojans pulling for their lives to
escape fierce giants into the ‘ wild forests of Jove or the groves
of Diana.' But beyond the main point, (a tall giant like a tall
tree,) which is obvious, there is no resemblance and even no
relevance. The Cyclopes are not ‘ cone-bearing' ε the beautiful
word aeriae suggests anything but a savage ogre: and the
religious associations of ‘silva Jovis lucusve Dianae' are still
less illustrative.

This is what we may call the primitive use of the simile,
and it is employed in Homer, and imitated by many poets
since. There is however a modern use of the simile which is
quite different. 1f we open Shelley we read ·

‘The golden gates of Sleep unbar
Where strength and beauty met together

Here there is nothing obvious in the comparison‚ but yet there
is a profound appropriateness, not merely in the image, but in
all the suggestions of it, the beauty, the isolation from others,
the reflection of the brilliance‚ the infinity‚ the serenity. Or

again,

“ Life like a dome of many-coloured glass
Staz'ns the white radiance qf Eternz'ty
'Untz'l Deatlz tramples it to fragments.'’
