‘I tear up herbs and gnaw the roots’.

652. uisset. He said to himself huic me addico quaecunque sum't

num exitium.. ‚futurum. ‘With this, whatsoe’ er it were, 1 east in my

[655-691. They sight Polyphemus, a huge staggering blinded
giant. He comes out to wash his eye in the sea ε they take the Greek
on board, and silently row off. Polyphemus hears, and bellows for aid:
the Cyclopes rush to the shore: the Trojans hurry away, a north wind
hel in .]

Ρ657ἓῖ Polyphemus is on'e of these Cyclopes.

658. This heavy lumbering line is imitative of the huge monster
labouring along. ‘a monster awful, shapeless‚ huge, and berest of light’.

659. trunca manu, ‘lopped by his hand' suggests the giant
strength which naturally breaks off and dresses a pine tree as a man
might a stick. The other reading manum is not so good 1n sense.

660. N ot1ce the characteristic touch of pity for the poor blind
helpless giant: the nearest approach to this pity in Homeris the simple
and pathetie address of Polyphemus to his ram Κριὲ πέπον &c., Od.
tx.

646427. At first sight a slight difficulty. ‘when he touched the deep
waters and reached the sea ' gwhich looks the wrong order, as Con. takes
it. But probably the idea of aequora is tlte deep sea as opposed to the
surf and shallows. The giant wades some way to wash his eye, the
deep sea being not deep to him.

663. inde, ‘with the water' z only Vergil says ‘from the water’
i. e. wi th water taken fiom- thence.

666. recepto supplice sic merito, ‘taking on board our suppliant‚
who had so well deserved’: i. e. who had done us such service by
timely warning5

669. vox is used sor many sounds besides tlte vozce: thus of a
trumpct, vu. 519 ad vocem qua buccina signum dedit. the echo of
a blow on a rock, vocis imago G. lv. 49: and of the breakers, 556.

670. adfectare usually to ‘reach at' ‘aim at’, here used by a
stretch of meaning for‘ to reaeh'. Vergil after his manner means to
suggest the groping and touching with the same word.

671. Ionios, 21.

aequare sequendo, ‘rival m the chase’, the poet imaginatively con-
ceiving it as a race between the giant and the sea.

672. As usual we have the sound followed in due order· the sea,
the land, the echo from the caverns. So v. 150, vnl. 216.

677. nequzquam lzmzzne corve, ‘baffled, with savage glare’.
