44 VERGJL. AEN. III.

dare classibus Austros, ‘to welcome the South winds to our ships'
variation for dare classes Austris. [The South wind is hardly the most
favourable‚ as they sailed South to Delos: a slight oversight.]

62. instauramus, ‘we solemnize': instauro properly no doubt ‘to
set up ³, then used of celebrating festivals or holy rites, whence naturally
comes the sense to solemnize afresh, to renew or repeat: and there may
be a suggestion of this here, as Polydorus had been buried amzss before.

63. The Romans usually elected two altars to the shades, Dis
Manibus, of the dead. Cf.· geminas sacraverat aras 305. The Manes
[old adj. manis ‘good', ‘the good people’, euphemism for ‘the spirits ’J
were the shades of the dead.

64. maestus, as usual of the expression of sorrow: ‘decked sor the
mourning with b’lue fillets and black cypress'.

65. Ili,ades Greek form, ‘women of Ilium' or Troy.

crinem solutae might be acc. of respect, ‘unbound as to their hair’.
but considering Vergil' 5 usage, it is more probably an accusative qf the
object afler the passive, a use widely employed by Augustan poets.1t
imitates the Greek use, either middle (like προβεβλημένος τὴν ασπίδα.

‘having put his shield before him’ ), or passive (like ἐπιτετραμμένος τὴν
ἀρχήν ‘having been entrusted with the power '.) Vergil probably did not
distinguish these uses: and they are often hardly distinguishable.
Other examples of the middle use are os impressa toro IV. 659. defixus
lumina vl. 56· curru subiuncta leones Χ. 157. And passives:
barbam Χ. 83 8· per pedes traiectus lora ΙΙ. 272. suspensi loculos lacerto
I-lIffr. gat. 1 vl. 74: below 428. The prose usage would always be
a a 5

68. The reference is to the farewell cry in the funeral ceremony·
‘have atque vale‘.

[69—120 They sail to Delos. The priest welcomes them to
Apollo' 5 temple: Aeneas prays for an omen. The god bids them seek
their ancient mother. Anchises reminds them that the cradle of their
race is Crete, and bids them sail thither. He offers sacrifices to Apollo
and the powers of the sea and storms.]

70. dant placata, Vergilian for placant. So laxas dare for laxare,
Ι. 63. vasta dabo for vastabo, IX. 323.

Auster, see note on 61.

lenis crepitans, adj. variation for adv, ‘the gently rustling breeze’.

73. colitur, richer word for ‘lies’. The tellus is the sacred island
of Delos. ’

74. Nereidum matri: the Nereids were sea-nymphs, daughters of
the sea-god Nereus : their mother was Doris.

Neptuno Aegaeo, the sea-god Neptune is called Aegaeo because the

poet is speaking of the Aegean sea or Archipelago, in the midst of
which lay Delos.

Notice the Greek rhythm: caesura and spondee in fisth foot‚ and
hiatus z such licenses being specially used by Vergil where Greek words

or names are employed, so Dardanio Anchisae lx. 6472 Parrhasio
Euandro XI. 31 ε languentis hyacinthi xl. 68.

75. The old story here referred to is that Latona mother of Apollo
ancl Diana was sheltered by Iuppiter from the jealousy of Iuno in Delos,
