to revise the Aeneid to his satisfaction, and expressed a wish
that it should be burned. This story, precious as a proof of
Vergil's ideal standard of workmanship, is to some extent borne
out by indications of inconsistencies‚ weaknesses, and incomplete
polish in parts of the great poem, though less in the earlier than
in the later books. And these incomplete lineS, which occur in
all the books of the Aeneid, are often quoted as examples of
this incompleteness. Not much stress can be laid on some of
these, as the break is often natural and sometimes even an im-
provement: thus in Book 111. 316 ne dubita, nam vera vides ;
340 quem tibi iam T roia...: and 52 5, 640, the abruptness seems
to heighten the effect. Others again seem to have no such jus-
tification and are probably unfinished passages. And generally
we may say that it is reasonable to doubt whether if the poet had

had the time he wished to complete the work, he would not have
altered many at least of such lineS.

Note on Vergz'l's peculz’art‘liss of style.

The object of style in literature, apart from the subject-
matter, is to produce effect by successful choice of words.
Sometimes the effect is produced by using the simplest words
and phrases to express the idea : sometimes by the use of rare
or choice words, unusual turns of phrase, stretches of meaning,
or even stretches of grammar. The first we may call the
simple, the second the elaborate or artificial style. It is useless
to ask which is the best ε each will suit best in turn the genius of
certain writers, the subject of certain poems, certain situations
or ideas, and the taste of certain readers : many poets will use
them both at different times: and both may be most effective
in the hand of a master. And each too has its danger: the
simple is liable to fall into bathos and commonplace: the ela·
borate has a tendency to become turgid, stilted, over-artificial.

Take as an instance of the simple style the well—known line
of Wordsworth :—

K “Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.”
