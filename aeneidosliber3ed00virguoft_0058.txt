Lacedaemonios. Vergil is' following the Homerie story which makes
Menelaus king of Lacedaemon, not (as later tales do) of Argos.

329. ‘ Gave me to captive Helenus, a captive wise '. que is gram·

matically superfluous, though natural: the thought is ‘gave me to the
captive Helenus and I was a captive too '. Con. quotes v. 447 ipse
gravis graviterque... : obvius adversoque occurrit x. 734.

oracle he slew his mother Clytaemnestra in revenge for her treacherous
murder of his father Agamemnon, and that he went mad in consequence:
(2) that he loved and was betrothed to Hermione, and when she was
given to Pyrrhus he lay in wait and killed his rival.

furiis, ‘the madness ’ rather than the personified F uries z though to
Vergil and his readers the two senses would lie near together. But if
clearly personified he would have written ‘ a furiis '. Henry quotes 1. 45

irffitead of wounding Aeneas' feelings by referring to the happy life of

This is better than transposing the line after 336, as Madv. and K.
do, though it makes good sense there too: but the change is needless.

341. Commentators are troubled because Andromache could not
have heard of Creusa's death. Vergil is not careful about such trifles.
