who tells them os the Cyclopes. Polyphemus appears and they
fly, coasting round the south of Sicily till they reach Drepanum,
where Anchises dies· Thence a wind drives them to Car-
thage.

Book IV. tells of the love, desertion, despair, and suicide of
the Carthaginian queen Dido. Book V. is an interlude, giving
an account of the games held in Sicily, whither they are again

. driven by a storm. At last Aeneas reaches the promised land.

One of the most effective portions of the Aeneidis his
descent to Hades by the lake of Avernus near N aples, where
he meets his dead father, Anchises, who shews him the souls of
the future great men of Rome. He then emerges from the
realms below and rejoins his fleet.

Reaching at length the coast of Latium, he discovers by a
sign that this is his fated home. He sends to the king Latinus
to offer peace, which is at first agreed t0, and Aeneas is betrothed
to Lavinia, daughter os the king ; but difficulties arise, the gods
interfere, and Turnus, king of the Rutules‚ who is a suitor of
Lavinia, induces Latinus to join him in war against the
Trojans.

Aeneas meanwhile sails up the Tiber, and makes alliance
with the Arcadian Euander, who is king of the small tribe on the
site of the future Rome.

Euander advises him to seek aid from the Etruscans of
Caere, which he does. The war is begun. After much blood-
shed, in which Pallas son of Euander, and the terrible Tuscan
king Mezentius, are slain, it is at last agreed that the issue shall
be decided by single combat between Aeneas and Turnus.
Juno tries to interfere; but at length the heroes meet, and
Aeneas grapples and slays Turnus.
