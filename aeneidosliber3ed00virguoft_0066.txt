62 VERGIL. AEN. III.

530. The place is called Castrum Minervae, and lies just at the
heel of Italy a few miles N. of the Sallentinian promontory. Vergil as
so often suggests the name, rather than exactly gives it, by using the
words arce Minervae.

‘ The harbour that opens ' is Portus Veneris.

533. N otice ab with an inanimate agent fluctus: due to the per⁴
sonifying instinct of the poet. ‘ By Eastern waves bent into an arch’.
[Ovid uses this ab without any such justification‚ as a kind of con-
venient poetical variation, e.g. capiuntur ab hamis, factus ab arte.]
Eurous, driven on by the East wind or Eurus.

535. latet, ‘lies hid '. Several commentators object that this is in-
consistent with patescit above t but Henry rightly remarks that the poet

first makes the ships enter (harbour opens...temple appears...they land),
then describes the harbour [Portu5...templum].

536. refugit, ‘retires'.

5 38. late simply means that the horses are ‘ scattered’ over the field.

546. praeceptis: abl. of attendant circumstances (like iussu tuo and
many others) ‘ following the charge of Helenus ’. “ ’

maxima by a common variation in the relative clause instead of
agreeing with praeceptis in the principal clause.

547. adolemus: rather a strange word, like several religiones words
used in peculiar half-technical senses. Thus originally ‘to increase ’,
‘to magnify' (cf. adolescere, al-o, διε.) it comes to be used, like macto,
for ‘to honour’ gods: and we have the following uses: to honour, '
adolere penates, 1. 704: to offir, here: to burn, verbenas adolere,

Iuno was specially the protectress of Argos.

549. ‘We turn the sailyard horns' the cornua being the bent tips
of the sailyards. Obverto usually with dat„ or an acc. with in, to express
that towards which the thing is turned. Here it is used absolutelyz
‘we turn round ἐ the whole expression suggests the turning round of
the ship to go to sea again, the opposite of proras ad litora torquent,

2.
53 [The notion of Henry and Con. that the horns being bent back
must be turned to land when they went to sea, and obvertunt means
obvertunt terrae seems very unlikely. No poet could describe going to
sea by saying ‘they turn the horns to land . obvertor is ‘to face round '‚
and the buckward pointing· horn is not in the poet’s mind.]

550. Graiugenae [Graius, gen-], ‘sons of the Greeks ’. suspecta·
because Helenus had told them ‘ all these shores are filled with the
Greeks your foemen ', 398.

551. hinc, ‘next' like Greek ἐντεῦθεντ after leaving the Castrum
