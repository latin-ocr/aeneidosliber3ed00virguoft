NOTES. 47

‘revelled over on its mountains'. iugis prob. local. Verg. uses this
deponent again passive G. 11. 487 bacchata Lacstenis Taygeta (see 143)-

126. umam, because of the famous Parian marble.

127. ‘ We thread the seas boiling round many an isle ' a perfectly
natural sense, and concita the reading of nearly all the Mss. Others
(Hen. Con.) read consita ‘ sown ' ‘ studded 'z also natural, but less sup-
ported, and more like a repetition of sparsas.

129. petamus, oblique jussive so common in V. ‘ bid us seek .

¹3¹· Curetes, priests of the Idaean Zeus or Iuppiter in Crete z like
the Corybantes they worshipped with a rude beating of cymbals.

134. amare, for inf. see 32. So again 144·

arcemque attollere tectis, ‘ build high the roofed citadel ' is the sense,
but the phrase is varied after V.'s manner, who particularly strains the
abl. instr. thus= see 28.

135. The comm. raise a difficulty about fere. But it does not
rnean ‘ almost ' with subductae, which as everybody sees makes no sense:
n geegnvdltthheaships’vegssdlqorffijldsilffigeldedvodg{headry shore ' &c- So
we have iamque fere V. 327, 335: haec fere, plerumque sere, satis· fere,
and with numbers, where the meaning ‘ nearly ' will not suit.

136. conubiis, probably (Munro, Lucr. ΠΙ. 776) to be scanned
canabat: (not as others say, &nubit-s), the u being only long in arsis, as
conubia nostra, 1v. 316.

‘The youth were busied with marriage and new tillage '.

137—9. Notice the strained and elaborated phrases, to give effect
to the horror: ‘ On a sudden from the infected arch of heaven there
fell a wasting plague on their bodies, a piteous blight on trees and
crops—a· year of death ε’

140. dulces, ‘dear’ life ε pointing the struggle against the pest.

141. Sirius, ‘the fiery Sirius’ (the dog-star), whose rising was the
signal for the hot weather. He is always spoken of as ‘ baneful '‚
‘raging ', 810.

[As a matter of fact, the identification of Sirius' rising with the hot
weather was borrowed from the Greeks, and had ceased to be true when
Vergil wrote ε it had become one of the conventions of poetry.]

stm'les exurere, ‘scorched to barrenness’, proleptz‘c use of adj. [like
sucked dry, worn thin] describing result of verb: so, e. g. v. 255
sublimem rapuit.

exurere, historic inf. used (as inf. gives the act without the time) in
confused sceneS, or rapid action, or protracted or repeated acts: or some-
times ofsteling.

143. remense, depon. used pass„ as often in the partic. So we
have dignatus, exorsus, partitus, oblitus, used pass. in V. ε and in this
book bacchata 12 5, venerata 460, dignate 475.

144. veniam, ‘favour’, ‘grace ': the word is connected both with
Venus and veneror ‚· the indirect questions which follow loosely but
naturally explain ventam. The favour is to give thern oracular answer
to their doubts.

145. laborum, gen. of remoter object ‘help sor our troubles’ like im-
gyriumest animarum ‘government over '‚ Caesaris coniunctio ‘union wilh?
