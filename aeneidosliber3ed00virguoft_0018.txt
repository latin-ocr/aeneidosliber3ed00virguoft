cave (623 sqq.) carries force of style in the relation of hori-ors
beyond the point which modern taste approves.

And there is in Vergil another and more peculiar quality
which only the greatest masters possess: and that is the art by
which quite simple things said naturally of the actors and
actions in his drama seem to have a wider significance, to

touch deeper springs in our nature, and to haunt the memory
with a charm which we cannot quite explainl.

The third book however is not so rich in instances of this

as some others, but the following lines will illustrate what 1
mean :—

44 Heu fuge crudeles terras, fuge litus avarum
(the line which haunted the memory of the great Savonarola).

98 et nati natorum et qui nascentur ab illis.

321 O felix una ante alias Priameia virgo
hostilem ad tumulum Troiae sub moenibus altis
iussa mori!

341 ecqua tamen puero est amissae cura parentis,

489 O mihi sola mei super Astyanactis imago!
sic oculos, sic ille manu5‚ sic ora ferebat
et nunc aequali tecum pubesceret aevo.

493 Vivite feliceS, quibus est fortuna peracta
iam sua: nos alia ex aliis in fata vocamur.
Vobis parta quies.

710 ...hic me, pater optime, fessum
deseris, heu tantis nequiquam erepte periclis!

A word should be said also about the unfinished lines, 218,
316, 340, 470, 527, 640, 661. It is well known as an old tradition
that the poet was surprised by his last illness before he had time

¹ So Dr Newman speaks of Vergil's ‘single words and phrases, his
pathetic half-lines giving utterance, as the voice of Nature herself, to

that pain and weariness yet hope of better things, which is the experience
of her children in every time.'
