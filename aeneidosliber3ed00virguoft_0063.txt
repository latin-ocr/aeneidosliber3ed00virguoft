’ it: Wars Ι see, Tiber foaming blood. t.he Trojan woes repeated, &c.'
and is justly described by the poet as obscuris vera involvens‘ truth
wmpgedpoe m ltnylsgegymbt preferred when he reached the sixth book to
modify the plan; to put a characteristic oracle into the Sibyl' s mouth,
and gransser the duty of detailed prophecy to the Ghost of Anchises
V1·0-2

< 9 ἴλας liceat: indefinite (or as it would better be called gene-ric)
use of subJ. ‘all that I may tell'.

462. dirigentem: proleptic‘ Lift Troy to the skies and make her great
b our eeds’

y >[r463—471. The presents of Helenus to the Trojans. ]

464. gravia· the long a is an archaism3 thus in old poetry we find
oppidi, omnia, debilia, loca: and the long vowel survives in postea,
propterea, antea, triginta, &c-

N ot1ce Greek rhythm as usual with Greek word. sectoque Ι elephanto.

465. stipatque carinis, ‘packs in the hulls’, Vergilian variation for
stipat carinas argento. So onerant dona canistris v111.180;and the
Scotch ballad: ‘and fill it in a silver tassie’.

466. Dodona was the ancient and famous oracle of Epirus, inland,
South of Chaonia, Helenus’ realm.

467. He means ‘a cuirass of triple links of gold' but after his
manner the phrase is elaborated. The aurum and hami are the same z
it is hendiadys, one idea presented in two ways. So v. 259, vu. 639.

470. e uos, for Epirus was famous for horses. ‘palmas Epiros
equarum’ eorg. 1. 59

471. remigium, abstraet for concrete, see 296, is best taken with

[472-505- Anchises urges us to depart, and Helenus the seer

winds would wait his will to rise.

483. picturatas, ‘with broideries of gold thread 'z to broider in
Latin is pingere acu.

484. nec cedit honori: a much vexed phrase. Briefly to clear the
ground, (1) it seems better to read leonori, of which MSS. are slightly
in favour, which Servius read, and which is the harder reading and less
likely to be altered. (α) if honori it must be dative3 no poet could
write cedit honori, cedit being common with dat., and mean honori for
archaic abl. (3) cedit coming between fert and onerat must have
Andromache for subject.
