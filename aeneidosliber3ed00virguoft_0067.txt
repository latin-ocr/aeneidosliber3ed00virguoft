Vergil himself had his doubts: si vera est fama. But the worship of
Hercules seems to have been widely prevalent in these parts: there
was the Heraclean promontory S. of Bruttium: Herculis Portus near
the straits: and most important of all, Heraclea in the bay of
Tarentum, founded by Tarentines. ¹

odysseus who escaped with some of his men, is well known from
the Odyssey, and is alluded to briefly below, line 619.
