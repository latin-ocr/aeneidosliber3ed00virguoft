42 VERGJL. AEN. III.

12. N otice the majestic sound : it well suggests the greatness of the
hero and his destiny. ‘ I go forth an exile to the deep, with my people
and my son, the Guardians of my horne, and our Great Gods’. Vergil
has made skilful use of a rude but power-ful line of Ennius ‘Dono‚
ducite, doque volentibus cum magnis Dis’.

Penates, gods of the household‚ including images of special gods,
such as Iuno, Iuppiter, &c. and sacred relies too.

[13—68. We land first in Thrace. There as we attempt to settle
an omen is sent us. As I was pulling up a myrtle, blood flowed and a
voice was heard, telling us Polydorus was buried here: we must fly.
Polydorus, given to the king of Thrace to rear, had been murdered. We
resolve to quit the defiled landt Polydorus we appease with burial rites]

13. Mavortia. Thrace being specially under the protection of
Mavors or Mars, god of war, see 35.

colitur, 73.

G ufgf Lchurgo mentioned in the Iliad as king of Thrace. [T kracls,
ree orm.

The dative after the passive is in imitation of the Greek dative after
perfect passive (καλῶς πέπρακται ἐκείνῳ), common in Augustans: e. g.

ἓιιῌει audita n6n'lzi Ι. 326: nihil tibi relictum, vl. 509: iuncta est mihi
extra VIII. 1 9.

V. also stretches the use of regno, which in prose is intransitive.
15. hospitium goes easily in apposition with terra, Penates more

loosely ε one leads to the other. ‘A land of old friendship and weleome ’

for Troy '.

16. dum...fuit‚ ‘while our fortune lasted’: observe dum with
perfect, always possible when the emphasis is on the fact not on the
duration, as dum res stetit Ilia 1. 268: dum terra labores praebuit
x. 321 z dum texit Imaona X. 4²4·

17. fatis iniquis, abl. of attendant circumstances. iniquis mans as
often ‘unfavourable'. ‘The fates not favouring my emprise’.

18. Aeneadae, ‘sons of Aeneas’. We know of no place or settle-
ment in Thrace with such a name: but the worship of Aphrodite
Aeneias in Sicily, and other accidental resemblances, seem to have
given rise to more than one story or invention like the present one.

19. Dionaeae matri, ‘my mother, daughter of Dione ’‚ the goddess
Venus or Aphrodite called in Homer (Il. v. 370) daughter of Dione.
[The name is originally a fem. form of Di- or Zeus: and is etymologi-
cally the same as the Latin luna]

20. auspicibus: he offered to them ‘as favouring his work ’, a
reverent way of entreating their favour.
23. ‘ The myrtle-thicket of bristling spears': the myrtle and cornel-

shoots being used for shafts. G. 11. 447 myrtus validis hastilibus et
bona bello cornus.

28. ‘Black blood-drops trickle out, and with foul spots stain the
ground’. N otice the Vergilian variation guttae...sanguine‚ lit. ‘drops

trickle with blood’. Cf. nigro pulvere nubem, virgulta sonantia lauro,
pictas abiete puppes.

30. gelidus coit, ‘freezes'. v
32. insequor, ‘I proceed', slightly strained but not unnatural
