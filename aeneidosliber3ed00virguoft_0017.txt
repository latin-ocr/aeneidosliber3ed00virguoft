farby the poet's deeper insight and quicker sensibility: and it
is splendidly illustrative all through: the bright colours com-
pared with' the pure white light resemble the chequered shifting
imperfect beauties of life compared with the changeless per-
fection of eternity: the narrow limited dome and the endless
vault of heaven give another equally deep contrast: and lastly‚
the perishable glass contrasted with the eternal spaces of the

v universe.

The more such similes are studied, the richer light is thrown
onthe comparison : they are not, like Vergil's, poetic miniature
pictures to be enjoyed independently3 they are profound lu-
minous resemblances‚ a permanent addition to our fancy and
insight‚ for which we are grateful to the higher gifts of the
poet.

Ῑ have said so much, to make it clear, that what Vergil aims
at in his similes is something quite different (and in one sense
far less) than what the modern poet (especially the lyric poet)
aspires to: for in order to appreciate the true poetic success of
Vergil, it is clearly necessary to understand his object, and so
avoid the mistake os judging him by an erroneous standard.

Note on the lez'rd Book.

The third book, though less interesting and important as a
whole than any of the first six, is artistically placed as a relies
between the two highly wrought tragedies of the Fall of Troy in
the Second, and the Love and desertion of Dido in the Fourth.
And though there are no passages of the sustained beauty and
sublimity such as those which describe the night attack on Troy,
the love of Dido, or the glories of the Rome to be, which are
foretold by AnchiseS, there is a good deal of variety and force in
the narrative of adventure. Thus the story of the murdered
Polydorus (zo-60), of the plague in Crete (135—145)‚ of the
‘storm at sea (196—204), of the Harpies (no—250), of Scylla
and Charybdis (420 sqq.), of the eruption of Aetna (570 sqq.),
are all effectively told. The description of Polyphemus in his
