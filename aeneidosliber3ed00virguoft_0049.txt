NOTES. 45

which till that time was a floating island, but which Iuppiter (or acc.
to Vergil’s version Apollo) fixed with chains.

pius, ·‘grateful’: but the word has reference to the love of the son to
the mother and so here is specially appropriate.

Arcitenens, ‘god of the bow’, Apollo, whose worship was centred in
Delos, where there was a magnificent temple and oracle of his.

76. Myconus and Gyarus are two small neighbouring islands.
Celsa is an unfortunate epithet‚ as the island is low, and is even called
humilis by Ovid.

77. ‘And fixed it to be a firm abode and scorn the tempest'. The
inf. after-dare is a common Vergilian constr. in imitation of the Greek
epelgggetlsslllffl‘g king of Delos, connected with Aeneas by various tales.

85. The words of the prayer are sufficiently introduced by venera-
bar, though ‘he said ' is not inserted as usual.

Thymbraeus, name of Apollo from Thymbra in the Troad, where he
:as‘givrzhhgpgdhome’ means obviously ‘guide us by an oracle’ to our

ome. ⁴
87. Pergama, the citadel of Troy.

reliquias Danaum means ‘remnant saved from the Danai '. The
gen. is slightly strained, but really is subjective: ‘the‘y left the remnants'.

Danai, one of the numerous poetic words for ⁸ Greek ’, from Homer.
Τὴε words Grai, Achivi, Argivi, Pelasgi, Argolici are also used.

88. quem sequimur, ‘ whom must we follow?' vivid use of present
for future or deliberative z so quid ago? XII. 637, quis apparat? lx. 146,
qffpfflggapitot? 3ᾇ71ὶῖῗ80 in English ‘Do you g'o abroad this year?’
‘ e you 1n1ng o-ni '

91. Notice the li'bense liminaque laurusque, imitated from Homer
(e.g. Λάμπον τε Κλὺτιόν τε), usually before double consonants‚ as lappae-
que‘ tn'bolique, G. 1. 153 ; tribulaque traheaeque, ib. 164: spiculaque
clipeique Α. vn. 186.

92. mons, mount Cynthus where the temple was.

mugire δια, ‘the shrine flew open, the caldron resounded’. cortina,
properly a ‘bowl’ or ‘vessel’: here the ‘caldron ’ of the god supported
on a tripod, with slab at the top where the priest sat to deliver oracles.
This at least was the description of the Delphz'c oracle‚ of which V.
uses the same word cortina, vl. 347.

94—97. The poet uses a legend that connected Dardanus with
Italy, and so gives dignity to his beloved land, by making the immigra-
tion of the Trojans a return to their home.

ΤΙιε oracle is also a good example of the misleading character of
such utterances: for of course the Trojans misunderstand it.

94. duri, ‘hardy ', ‘suffering’: like the Homeric πολυτλάς.

98. Notice the stately sound. ‘And sons, and sons' sons, and the
race to be’. The Homeric line which suggests it is (as often) simpler
and less impressive.

roz. veterum volvens monimenta virorum, ‘pondering the memories
of the men of old’; another stately-sounding phrase. Notice the
favourite alliteration of v's.
