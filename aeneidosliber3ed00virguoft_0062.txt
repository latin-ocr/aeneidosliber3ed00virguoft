58 VER GJL. AEN. III.

VII. 189: haud animo nequiquam exterrita mater (‘not·vainly moved
with a mother's fears') vn. 370 z natam egregio genero des pater (⁶give
thy child to a noble prince as a fatlzer may’) xx. 356.

The emphasis and rhetorical repetition ‘if Helenus hassorengglat...jf
his word is trusty,...if Apollo breathes trutlz into his heart...’ is
dramatic: it is to accentuate the earnest advice which follows: ‘Pro-

itiate Iuno ’.
p 439. supera: bold and effective word, ‘win’ her, ‘prevail with‘ her.

441. Cymaeam...urbem‚ Cumae, a Greek colony on coast of
Campania, N. E. of the bay of Naples: founded partly from Chalcis
in Euboea, partly from Cyme in Aeolis (Asia Minor). Vergil intention-
ally keeps the Greek form.

442. ‘ The holy lakes and Avernus with his rustling forest ’. Close
to Cumae are four or five lakes (Avernus, Lucrinus, Acherusia
&c.) all supposed to have mysterious connection with the lower world.
Even the line itself has a weird and impressive sound.

443. The ‘frenzied prophetess' is the Cumaean Sibyl, the most
famous of the mythical prophetie women called Sibyls. She is de-
scribed (Aen. V1. 1—100) as living in a vast cave with a hundred
openings, and being inspired by Apollo. The strange story of the
Sibyl’s leaves here told is evidently an old local tradition such as Vergil
delighted to weave into his national poem.

444. The ‘marks and names' are clearly writing: the idea is that
one prophecy is written on several leaves, and can be read only when
they are in order.

446. in numerum, ‘in order’: so of the measured beat of Cyclops’
hammers VIII. 453. Similarly in orbem V111. 673.

448. eadem by the run of the line clearly refers (not to the Sibyl,
as some take it, but) to the carmina on the leaves ε quaecumque...seclusa
...illa...eadem follow too closely on each other. ‘but yet, when the
hinge is swung, and the soft wind stirs them, and the open door
disorders the light leaves '. The slight elaborateness and artificial
character of the phrase is instinctively adopted, as often in Vergil, to
soften the primitive grotesqueness of the story: in plain language, ‘ when
the door opens and a puff of wind blows the leaves about ' would sound
beneath the epic dignity.

452. inconsulti must mean ‘uncounselled’ though it is a strained

use (ff the word. The nom. is easily supplied z the people who seek an
orac e.

odere.- emphatic Vergilian for ‘ shun ’.

45 3. morae dispendia: unusual and strained phrase for ‘loss of time’.

tanti...quin goes together, ‘let no loss of time count so high...that
you fail to visit...': quin is justified by the sense, fuerint tanti praeti-
cally = impediant.

454. cursus...v0cet, ‘thy voyage invite thee'‚ a bold but effective
personification.

457. canat...resolvat.· oblique jussives after poscas ⁴ pray her...to
sing herself the oracle‚ and unseal her lips...'.

460. venerata: passive, 143.

The Sibyl in book VI. (83—97) gives them the promised prophecy,
