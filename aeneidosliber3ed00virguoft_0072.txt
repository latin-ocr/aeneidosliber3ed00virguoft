693. Πλημμύριον means ‘the place of surges’ or ‘tides’ so that
undosum gives the meaning in Latin, like pluvias Hyadas above, 516.

694. The story was told variously, but Ovid's version is as follows:
Alpheus, god of the famed river of Elis in Peloponnese, once felt the

gushes is called by her name. Alpheus fled after her and mingled his
waters with hers.

700. ‘ Camarina whom oracles forbade should ever be disturbed ’.

The story was: Camarina lay near a marsh'whence a pestilence
arose. The people asked the god if they should drain it ; the oracle
replied μὴ κίνει Καμάριναν, ἀκίνητος ’γὰρ ἀμείνων (⁴ do not touch
Camarina, ’tis better untouched'), but they neglected the god and
drained it. The pestilence was cured, but the city lay open to the
enemy, who entered by the dry marsh and took it. ¹

The marsh is now wet again, and is the Lago di Camarana.

gen. ending in -z‘i in Vergil’s time is very rare and doubtful: (3) because
neither town nor river are naturally called immanis: (4) because Gela
has a long. None of the reasons are very strong.

If we keep the line, immanis is best taken gen. (in spite of a rather
unnatural order), and referred to the violence of the stream. ‘Gela
named from its cruel river’. So Ovid calls the same river non
adeundus, F ast. ιν. 470.
